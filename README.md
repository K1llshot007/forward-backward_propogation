# forward-backward_propogation

Python Functions are made to do forward and backward propagation dor different techniques.

The techniques for which the forward and backward propagation is developed are :
  - Relu
  - Max pool
  - Mean pool
  - Softmax
  - Fully Connected


All the work done is part of CSE 586 Computer Vision class taught by Prof Robert Collins, PSU

The functions are then tested based on the test file included as part of the assignment, for correctness and to check their working, the format of the test file is included in the index.py file as comments

The full assignment is done independently by Abhinav Sachdeva, MS (Computer Science and Engineering), PSU
